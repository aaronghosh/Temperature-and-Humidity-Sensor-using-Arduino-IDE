# Temperature-and-Humidity-Sensor-using-Arduino-IDE
In this arduino based project, ambient temperature and humidity is measured and displayed on a LCD screen. A combined temeperature and humidity sensor DHT11 is used with Arduino UNO to develop this project. The LCD screen displays the Temperature and Humidity in real-time and the green LED switches off and red LED switches on when the temperature and humidity increase above safe levels
